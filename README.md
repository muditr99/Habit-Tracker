# Habit Tracker

Problem Statement :

Create a habit tracker app, where we can define habits and track them. Create a fullstack app with Nodejs and Ejs

## Features Required


-> Add multiple habits to track like reading a book, going to the gym etc

-> Track each habit everyday. These are the 3 statuses of a habit:
    
   a) Done - Mark the habit as done for a day

   b) Not done - Mark the habit as not done for a day

   c) None - User did not take any action on a habit for a day


-> A view to show all current habits. Here give an add button where you can add a new habit to track.

-> A view to display 7 days of each habit

   a) Show today where user can mark todays habit

   b) And show the previous 6 days and the status of that habit for each day

   c) A user can toggle between the three (above mentioned) statuses of a habit i.e. I can change todayâ€™s status as done, not done or none anytime.

   d) Also I should be able to change any of the previous days status i.e. I can change the status of a habit for yesterday, day before yesterday or any previous 6 days as well


-> Store the data in a DB
